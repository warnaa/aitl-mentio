# AUTH-020: refuse duplicate github registration

- **Area:** AUTH
- **Priority:** High
- **Type:** UI/API integration
- **Requirement:** [Feature contract](../../specs/implemented/2026-09-04-accounts-and-roles.md).
- **Implementation:** [TypeScript test](../../../tests/integration/auth.integration.test.ts)
- **Executable case:** `TC-AUTH-008 GitHub and email accounts for the same address / refuses to register an address tied to a GitHub account, pointing to GitHub (edge case 14)`
- **Native executable ID:** `TC-AUTH-008`.
- **Prerequisites:** an owned GitHub-only account and a fresh signed-out browser; use the native ephemeral integration runner and controlled configuration, never a developer database.
- **Determinism:** Fixed business inputs and mock GitHub/log-mail adapters control the flow. Browser sessions are isolated and closed. Process IDs/sequences only namespace owned records; no random seed determines expected outcomes. Browser waits target observable text rather than fixed sleeps.

## Given-When-Then

```gherkin
Given an owned GitHub-only account and a fresh signed-out browser
When submit email registration for its existing address
Then The UI says This email address signs in with GitHub. Choose Continue with GitHub. and does not show Check your inbox.
```

## Steps and expected results

| Step | Action | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Prepare an owned GitHub-only account and a fresh signed-out browser. | The prerequisite state exists inside the owned integration environment. |
| 2 | submit email registration for its existing address. | The UI says This email address signs in with GitHub. Choose Continue with GitHub. and does not show Check your inbox. |
| 3 | Inspect the assertion outputs and any captured artifacts before teardown. | The exact native case assertions determine pass/fail; an unexecuted case has no observed success. |

## Related negative and boundary cases

The duplicate identity boundary is covered. The existing synthetic literal password is a test-policy gap; registration schema and other linking failures are separate cases.

This document maps one native executable case; existing bundled assertions are described honestly rather than silently split or rewritten. The [full integration contract](../../../tests/integration/AGENTS.md) governs isolation and semantic selectors. Relevant positive, validation, permission, missing-resource, conflict, provider-error, boundary and replay classes are covered only where stated above. No extra provider timeout or failure assertion is claimed. The all-15-section guide assessment records the specific existing gaps above; semantic roles/labels and concrete assertions are retained, helpers are named by purpose, and human review remains pending.

Related executable cases in this area: [AUTH-009](AUTH-009-cancel-github-without-account.md), [AUTH-010](AUTH-010-sign-in-mentee-to-home.md), [AUTH-011](AUTH-011-sign-in-mentor-to-workspace.md).

## Cleanup

Browser sessions close in finally (or the existing inBrowser wrapper), with failure screenshots/console diagnostics where implemented. Owned account/profile/invitation/slot data remains inside the native runner's disposable database until global teardown; these historical cases do not individually delete those rows. The runner stops its app process tree and database on success or failure.

## Verification and review

- **Latest execution:** Not run in this invocation as of 2026-11-05. Selected for the pending `npm run test:integration` full-suite execution; this documentation task does not execute tests.
- **Observed result and evidence:** No execution result is claimed. Setup, actions and expected assertions were checked against the exact linked TypeScript case. Runtime screenshots/logs, when produced, remain in ignored [integration artifacts](../../../test-results/integration/).
- **Human review:** Pending; automation and agent review do not establish human review.
